This repository is an exploration of building a Transformer network "from scratch," only using PyTorch and a simple synthetic dataset.

The exploration mostly relies on Mary Phuong and Marcus Hutter's [Formal Algorithms for Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09238).

The goal will be for the transformer to learn a binary sequence following a set of rules:
